My primary aim with a portfolio would be to make an appealing site for my writing, 
but most specifically, for the sake of having a defined aesthetic, it would be to 
promote my novel Pretty Like a Veil, rather than just all my writing.
To reflect some themes of the book, a purple shade and a not-quite full black would be 
the main choices for margins/backgrounds, as both of these colors align with themes and 
major components in the novel. White, gray, and red/orange are also colors that align with 
the novel’s aesthetic. Font would be black or white or violet, depending on how it meshes 
with the aesthetic of the page. Backgrounds, outside of the chosen pictures would basically 
all be either white, purple, or black, depending on the page. The body will stick mostly 
to photos with grays, purples, and whites as the aesthetic.  
These would be the backgrounds for the 9 pages 
Page 1 – Bio - Home Page (Pexals depiction of a castle ruin against a violet sky with black margins would be used instead) 
Page 2 (Background will be the photo of the violet clouds)# CHANGED THIS TO Purple_Lightning photo with various purple 
and violet text boxes. 
Page 3 (Background the clear violet sky with the lightning) 
Page 4 (Background Gray Hallway Photo with similarly gray margins)

Hi, I am Ryan Landes (REMOVED) and Pretty Like a Veil is a novel about Suicide in pre and post COVID America. It is about American fatalism—the things we do in the pursuit of happiness that are actually in the pursuit of self-destruction. It is about a strange dark castle that looks like a jagged fallen asteroid. 
And it is about a charming man named Lacidius…or Ladicius as he sometimes calls himself by mistake. He is the host of the castle and he speaks in poetic riddles.  
Now go onward… 
Follow the trail into Lacidius’s castle. It’s like H.H. Holmes meets Hotel California. /(removed)What could ever go wrong?

PORTFOLIO 1
https://www.velvetspectrum.com/
This portfolio has a fun selection of colors, a header font that really pops, and 
despite being fairly visually appealing, it does not do so at the expense of clarity at all. 
I liked how the main section’s pictures would alter into a form where text would show clearly 
over a layer of transparency that would dull the colors of the photos. 
The footer kept up the same tasteful format with some links to his 
social media accounts. 
When you do follow these links, they are great multi-media showcases for his work!  


PORTFOLIO 2 
https://socketstudios.com/
This site could be very awkward at times, but I liked its generous use of space with 
stark minimalistic colors like white and black. 
I also enjoyed the way it felt quite exploratory the page, rewarding your curiosity 
or the little semi-jarring aesthetic change ups, the blank tomb-stone-like shape on 
the first page, the brightness of the second page, with its at the forefront copy, 
bold and large. Some of the pages did not have footers, or even main sections. 
It was interesting how you could move about from the copy on some of the sub-pages 
reached from a menu attached to a round text-less button, and it was interesting 
the animation for the social media out-links, although the whole thing was fairly clunky. 
I did like the minimalism though. The initial page didn’t even have a header or footer. 
There is the accelerated scroll button too that was an interesting touch too. 
Overall, a little hard to navigate and overwhelming, but good stuff. 

PORTFOLIO 3
https://www.jessica-caldwell.com/
I enjoyed this portfolio’s elegant simplicity and some little touches like how the 
background graphic near the header(?) shifted some when you scrolled. 
The header was very traditional and as was the footer. 
The various pages were good showcases for her work, with varied layouts 
and nice photos, keeping the same format on footers, which kept a nice consistency 
around the portfolio, its layout refusing to descend into something too vague 
and showy. These pages all have a paragraph in them with a heading that does not 
appear to be in the body, but it’s not in the head either. 
I don’t have any real problem with this site. 
There are times where it shows too many photos perhaps and isn’t clear 
enough about services offered.
