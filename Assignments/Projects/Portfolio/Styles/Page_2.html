      <p>Pretty Like a Veil is a novel about Suicide in COVID era America. It is about American fatalism, the things we do in the pursuit of happiness that are, in reality, in the pursuit of self-destruction. It is about a strange dark castle that looks like a jagged black asteroid. 
        It is about a charming man named Lacidius…or Ladicius as he sometimes calls himself by mistake.</p>

      <p>He is the host of the castle. He speaks in poetic riddles.</p>

      <p> Now go onward… </p>

      <a href="Page_3.html"style=><p>Follow the trail into Lacidius’s castle. It’s like H.H. Holmes meets Hotel California...</p>
