            <p>Check out these 4 daily practices to express your love and gratitude for nature.
            <h2>The Journey Begins</h2> <br>
            You find yourself waking in a field. Countless flowers grow across the Earth. White chrysanthemums, waves of tulips, red roses, yellow lilies. They role over the hills. They are everywhere, but each flower is unique. As you look upon each one, you do not just see flowers. You see lovers. You see family members. You see children. You see all the things that make you laugh and cry...You see the world.</p>
            
            <l><h3>1. "Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature." - Gerard De Nerval </h3> <br>
            You embrace the flowers. You embrace the field.
            
            <p><h3>2. "And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom." - Anais Nin </h3> <br>
            You begin to discover you too are a flower. You feel locked up for an instant, but a spark hits you - tickling your senses. Maybe it's the outstretched arms of your love...maybe it's the thankful look in your child's eyes. Maybe it's the feeling of satisfaction you feel when you feel you have done your part to help the world...maybe it's the creation of a fresh piece of art.<br>
            
            Either way, it is love. 
            
            You embrace this sacred sensation and you too begin to bloom with the other flowers. By embracing the flowers, you become one with them and one with the world.</p>
            
            <p><h3>3. "People from a planet without flowers would think we must be mad with joy the whole time to have such things about us." - Iris Murdoch </h3> <br>
            There is a great joy in front of you that you could previously not quite find. It is everywhere.  You feel utterly awash in it. You are blessed with deep tidings of joy.</p>

                <p><h3>4. "Nature always wears the colors of the spirit." - Ralph Waldo Emerson </h3> <br>
                    We are all part of nature. But, through life, we drift apart from the inborn nature that resides within. We drift apart from love. The cultures of today would have us always drifting, without giving us a moment to breathe. But, there is solid ground in this shifting world.  It is all around us.  It is the very the Earth we stand on, and it is never too late to reconnect with the Earth. Through the ancient ways we can do this, because love lies at the core of many of these ancient beliefs. <br>
                    
                    And love is truth. But, we often find ourselves shying away from truth - shying away from its brave palette. <br>
                    
                    Nature is always present to remind us of these lovely colors. Nature helps us remember love. Nature never wears a false-coat over the color of it's spirit. It reminds us to let our spirit run free.</p>
                    
                    <p><h3>5. "Discovering this idyllic place, we find ourselves filled with a yearning to linger here, where time stands still and beauty overwhelms." - anonymous </h3> <br>
                    It is in these sacred moments of tranquility where we are touched by nature that we find peace. We find truth. <br>
                    
                    These are the moments we wish would last forever. Only what is natural - what is love - can truly bring about these moments where our hearts stir our breath becomes deep with profound weight and all spiritual baggage is set firmly down. </p>
                    
                    <p><h3>6. "Whoever loves and understands a garden will find contentment within." - Chinese Proverb </h3>
                    The world is a garden. The soul is a garden. As such, the soul must be tended. It must be cultivated, made so it can grow and expand, take shape in beauty, not domineered, suffocated, tamed, or controlled. <br>
                    
                    Contentment comes from understanding. Understand the garden. Understand oneself. <br>
                    
                    Understand love. You stand in this universal garden and you are free. </p>
                    
                    <p><h3>7. "Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby." - Langston Hughes </h3> <br>
                    You feel a light trickle touch upon your scalp. The clouds converge in thick hazy shrouds, yet they are still lovely as you peer up, such is the unconditional.  The air grows chill. You hear a crackle followed by a boom. Lighting traces across the sky. <br>
                    
                    The rain starts to fall harder. The drops explode across smooth stones in the garden. The ground is slick and shiny, the dirt moistened. You can hear a rustling in the forest ahead. Animals are scurrying.  The circle of the world has been set in motion. Your skin feels moist beneath the cascading drops. Your being feels like rebirth.  You look into the woods ahead, trees bunched tightly together, branches swaying overhead. <br>
                    
                    Something is calling to you - a lilting melody unsung, daring your heart to stir - your pulse a hushed flicker. <br>
                    
                    You begin to descend into the now-shadowed woods. You wonder when the rain will stop. You wonder if you'll be glad when it' gone. Perhaps you might miss the refreshing cascade and its soft tranquil patter. <br>
                    
                    You wonder when love will come. You wonder when love will go. <br>
                    
                    You know love is all around you - it is fleeting...yet immortal. Like all things...like the Earth itself...love must be nourished within us all - down every winding path - down every lush shaded thicket. </p>
                    
                    <p><h3>8."The woods are lovely, dark and deep.</l> <br> But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep." - Robert Frost </h3> 
                    Sometimes what we seek seems illusive. Sometimes it's right in front of us - waiting. But, the truth is that it resides at our center. It is up to us to center ourselves to better appreciate the treasure that lies everywhere. <br>
